1.	Clustering Case Study
Problem Statement :-
    Here in this case study, I had to analyse how and whom to extend humanitarian aid being raised by an NGO through Unsupervised K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering
What I did :-
    a. First I did data quality check to find any NULL values, then EDA(Univariate & Bivariate Analysis) to find the distribution of error terms and bi-variate to find the
       correlation between independent variables , outlier analysis, Standard Scaling
    b. Then I used Hopkins statistics to find if the dataset is suitable for clustering, Silhoutte plot to find highest silhouette point and optimal number of K means cluster          and Elbow curve to find the point after which the distortion start decreasing in linear fashion. 
    c. Then I did K-means cluster profiling by creating Bar chart comparison of child mortality rate, income and gdp of the nation to find the groups which are in dire need of          aids.
    d. Then I did Hierarchical cluster profiling based on single and complete linkage to find the shortest and longest distance between points in cluster and made 5 clusters and        put countries under each cluster and then plotted a scatterplot. After this we plotted barplot to find the cluster having high child mortality, low income and low gdpp
Conclusion :-
    Finally we concluded by identifying top 5 countries for funding of humanitarian AID

2. Online Education company case study
Problem Statement :-
    An online education company wants to sell online courses to the industry professional who check the courses by visiting the website. So need to find out the potential leads by identifying top 3 variables which can help in leads getting converted
What I did :-
    a.	First check the data for understanding purpose
    b.	I did Data cleaning  by dropping the NULL values more than 45% and dropped highly skewed values and imputed numerical with median values 
    c.	I did EDA through Univariate and Bi-variate analysis and outlier analysis
    d.	I did train test split and scaled the data through standardised scaling
    e.	After that I did Data modelling through mixed analysis , first through RFE and then through Manual approach to find the optimal set of data through GLM and VIF
        to reduce the number of variables less than 15. Also plotted a ROC curve to find the cut-off value
    f.	Also I did precision to find the positive rate and recall to find the positive predicted value
Conclusion :-
    After doing the analysis on confusion matrix, I found out that top 3 variables responsible for lead conversion.

3.	SQL Case Study
Problem Statement :-
    In the case study, I had to suggest an Indian film production company, RSVP movies their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.
What I did :-
    We ran queries on SQL to derive insights from the data.
Conclusion :-
    a. We came to a conclusion that Drama genre should be preferred by the company having average movie duration of 106.77 minutes.
    b. Month of March witnesses maximum release so they should also release the film during this month.
    c. They should collaborate with Marvel Movies, Dream Warrior Pictures and National Theater Live for producing films.
    
4.  Portfolio Management of Client (Capstone project)

Objective: To manage the portfolio of two elite customers by analysing the following various attributes of stock selected among the 4 sectors (Aviation, Finance, Pharma Health care, Technology):-

Key Achievements: Recommended 2 stocks each from the Pharma and Technology sectors as per the risk appetite of the customers

5.  IMDV Movie

Objective :I have the data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this assignment, I have tried to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python

Solution: I have visualised the data through EDA in python and derive useful insights

Key Achievements :-  Find the cross analysis of US and non US movies w.r.t US and non US voters. Also find the top genre movie which is most unpopular among top 1000 voters.

6.  Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services

Objective: In the case study I have been assigned to evaluate two kinds of risk (i.e;1.Credit Loss 2.Interest Loss pertaining to Banking Sector and to minimize these risks further. Thus, helping to improve business more specifically “Profit”

Solution: I have done EDA and tried to find out the solution by Data visualization

Key Achievements :I have identified specific factors which affect the repaying capacity of people

7.  Financial Aid to poor economies

Objective: I had to analyze how and whom to extend humanitarian aid being raised by an NGO through Unsupervised K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering

Solution: Built clustering model using unsupervised K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering to determine the countries which are in need of financial aid

Key Achievements: Predicted 5 top countries which are in dire need of financial aid

8.  Service

Objective :I was assigned  to build a multiple linear regression model for prediction of demand for shared bikes for A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes which witnessed dip in business due to COVID-19 lockdown and find variables which are significant in predicting the demand to improve business

Solution: Built Multi Linear regression model to predict the factors which may increase the demand for Shared bikes post covid period

Key Achievements : Predicted 3 key major factors affecting the Bike sharing business

9.  Sales

Objective :In the case study, I had to derive insights from an e- commerce data to suggest various ways to improve the sales of a company by analysing customer behaviour

Solution :I analysed an e-commerce company data which was very large in volume, velocity and variety. I analysed the data on AWS cloud running Hive queries to get meaningful insights

Key Achievement : It was found that the Sales of a particular product increases during a certain period of the year and vice-versa and suggested top 10 customers to reward them.

10.  Sports

Objective: I have to build a Tableau dashboard of IPL statistics over the years since its inception in order to create an infographic for a newsletter that a nationally recognized news agency is working on. 

Solution: I imported the dataset on the Tableau platform for creating different visualizations and a Dashboard for
presenting insights.

Key Achievement: I found out various interesting insights like the correlation between Toss win and Match win, home advantages for the team, which team wins most of the matches away from home, etc.

11.   Hospitality

Objective: Airbnb has seen a major decline in revenue during the Covid-19 period. Now Post –The covid Period when things are coming back to the track, Airbnb wants to make sure that it is fully prepared for this change.
